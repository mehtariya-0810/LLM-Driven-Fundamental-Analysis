This is a basic system that takes a company's ticker from the user, downloads 10-K filling from 1995 to 2023 using SEC EDGAR API, pre-processes it, creates a vector database using CHROMA, and then using RAG, an open-source GPT4ALL LLM model gives fundamental analysis of that company, and suggests whether to buy or sell a stock of that company, along with an option to interact with the documents.
